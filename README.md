Fictional University is a website built with WordPress, an open-source content management system written in PHP and paired with a MySQL database. The purpose of this site is to showcase my full comprehension and capability to navigate WordPress CMS. Fictional University is a model example of an educational institution website fit to offer current and pontential students the ability to interact, blog, rate professors, and set up events, all in a dynamic and user friendly site. The steps taken to create this wordpress site were as follows: Set Up a New Theme using Local Host and text editor, Created Custom Post Types and Custom Fields,  Relate pieces of content with each other (e.g. a professor and a program), Leveraged the WP REST API, used JavaScript to communicate with the WordPress back-end on-the-fly. Addiotinally, I added ux features that would further the site's user interaction such as:  Letting visitors sign up for a basic account on this site,  Build a "My Notes" feature (user specific single page application with real-time CRUD actions),  Let users "like" or "heart" a professor (update the professor's like count on-the-fly).
